### [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Read%20on%2018--AUG--2020-green">

**Brief:** This paper is the kick-off for deep learning, from where all it started. Before this, there is no significant use of deep learning because they did not think it is the power horse for computer vision and other areas. Unavailability of computing power is a major drawback, lagged use of NNs. Because Neural Networks are computational hungry, they need to compute the addition and multiplication billions of times. Unavailability of the large labelled dataset is also the one reasons for slow progression in deep learning. Until the ImageNet(which consists of over 15 million labelled high-resolution images in over 22,000 categories) dataset arrived in, there are only datasets with hundreds and thousands of images. MNIST is the most experimented image dataset till then, and other datasets like CIFAR-10/100 and Caltech-101/256 are also available but are high resolution and realistic. AlexNet is trained on 1.2M images with 1000 categories, a subset of ILSVRC 2010 release. They achieved the top1 error of 37.5% and top5 error of 17%, which is a significant reduction compared to state of the art at that time. They said this research is only possible with current GPUs and we can do better research while waiting for the better GPUs. They used only two NVIDIA GTX 580 3GB GPUs which took five to six days for training. Overfitting is a severe problem in those time due to lack of large datasets, luckily now we never care about overfitting anymore. Four novel or unusual features of this networks architecture are ReLU Nonlinearity, Use of Multiple GPUs, Local Response Normalization, Overlapping pooling. ![ReLU](/alexnet/relu.png)Deep convolutional neural networks with ReLUs train several times faster than their equivalents with tanh or sigmoid units.Fig1 Dotted line is *tanh* and the solid line is *relu*, it is six-time faster than tanh. A single GTX 580 GPU has only 3GB memory which limits the size of the network. They used two GPUs and spread the network across the two GPUs.The parallelization scheme that employed essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick: the GPUs communicate only in certain layers. Similar to *Batch Normalization* we do they days they did *Local Response Normalization* which reduces the error over 1%. ![AlexNet Architecture](alexnet/alexnet1.png) This is the overall architecture of the AlexNet; the network contains eight layers with weights; the first five are convolutional and the remaining three fully-connected. The output of the last fully connected layer is fed to a 1000-way softmax produces a distribution over 1000 class labels. Response-normalization layers follow the first and second convolutional layers. Max-pooling layers, follow both response-normalization layers as well as the fifth convolutional layer. The ReLU non-linearity is applied to the output of every convolutional and fully-connected layer. Reducing the overfitting is also crucial for better performance. Data augmentation with image translations, random cropping, horizontal reflections and altering the intensities of RBG channels are done. Dropout is also used to reduce overfitting. Dropout consists of setting to zero the output of each hidden neuron with probability 0.5. The neurons which are *dropped out* do not contribute to forward pass and back-propagation. AlexNet achieved top-1 and top-5 test error rates of **37.5%** and **17.0%**. In the ILSVRC 2012 competition, AlexNet won the 1st place. They said removing any middle layer results in a loss of 2% for top-1 performance of the network. The performance can be increased, simply with deeper networks.![reluts](alexnet/result.png).

### [OverFeat: Integrated Recognition, Localization and Detection using Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6229)  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Read%20on%2029--AUG--2020-green">

**Brief:** **OverFeat** is the first paper that described how they did localization and detection. In the ILSVRC2012 competition, AlexNet won both classification and localization, but they did not mention how they did localization. So, In ILSVRC2013, OverFeat won in both localization and detection tasks and given a competitive performance in classification(won by ZFNet in 2013) task. By now, you are confused about what is the difference between localization and detection. I will explain, take a long breath. **Classification**: Classify the object within the image.**Localization**: Classify the objects and localize the objects by bounding boxes within the image.**Detection**: Like localization, we also need to classify the objects and localize the objects by bounding boxes but can contain small objects. The evaluation metric is different from localization. It also needs to predict the background class when there are no objects. OverFeat used the slightly modified version of AlexNet; they made *fast* and *accurate* models. They only difference is filter sizes in the first and second convolutional layers. The changes from AlexNet are there is no local contrast normalization (LRN) and no overlapping pooling. Larger feature maps at 1st and 2nd layers due to the smaller stride of 2.<img src="overfeat/architecture.png"> **Multi-Scale Classification** is used to increase the accuracy at inference. The entire image is used in six different scales. At test time, FC layers become 1*x*1 conv layers. The whole image is going into the network, and obtain a class map just like VGGNet.AlexNet obtains 18.2% Top-5 error rate.With **7 fast models + 4 scales + fine stride max-pooling**, the error rate has been greatly reduced to **13.86%**. With **7 accurate models + 4 scales + fine stride max-pooling**, the error rate has been greatly reduced to **13.24%**. We have already seen that different ensembling models will have a significant performance boost. **Fine Stride Pooling** is another technique used after the convolutional layer-5, and I do not want to go into the messy details of that. There is a regression network after the 5th Conv layer, 2 FC layers (4096,1024) and last layer with 4 x C(Classes) are used to predict bounding box coordinates.**Single-class regression (SCR)** and 4 scales achieves **29.9% error rate** in test set and won the **localization** task in **ILSVRC 2013**. For detection, the main difference is the evaluation metric and predicts a background class when there is no object. **OverFeat** also got **24.3% mAP** (mean average prediction) for detection task.Below are some examples of detection. Another technique called **greedy merge algorithm** is used to get the final bounding box.  <img src="overfeat/detection1.png">

### [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiUgZ7MlqnrAhVJzDgGHa1mCRoQFjABegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1311.2901&usg=AOvVaw0bGZH7N8K2NZ8upuy-gyju)  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Read%20on%2020--AUG--2020-green">

**Brief:** This is the paper that answers all your questions, why do convolutional network work better than any other methods. However, there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well or how they might be improved. Some of them tried to explain what is happening inside the network. In this paper, the authors introduced a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. As again said, Convolutional Networks (convnets) deliver outstanding performance on more challenging visual classification tasks. The reasons for this are 1) the availability of much larger training sets, with millions of labelled examples; 2) powerful GPU implementations, making the training of very large models practical. Visualizing features to gain intuition about the network is common practice, but mostly limited to the 1st layer where projections to pixel space are possible. Deconvolutional Network (deconvnet) can be thought of as a convnet model that uses the same components (filtering, pooling) but in reverse, so instead of mapping pixels to features does the opposite. To examine a given convnet activation, we set all other activations in the layer to zero and pass the feature maps as input to the attached deconvnet layer. Then we successively (i) unpool, (ii) rectify and (iii) filter to reconstruct the activity in the layer beneath that gave rise to the chosen activation.
![](zfnet/deconvnet.png)
*Top: A deconvnet layer (left) attached to a convnet layer (right). The deconvnet will reconstruct an approximate version of the convnet features from the layer beneath. Bottom: An illustration of the unpooling operation in the deconvnet, using switches which record the
location of the local max in each pooling region (colored
zones) during pooling in the convnet.*

Training is similar to AlexNet. One difference is that the sparse connections used in AlexNet layers 3,4,5 (due to the model being split across 2 GPUs) are replaced with dense connections. The model is trained on ImageNet 2012 training set (1.3 million images, spread over 1000 different classes). Each RGB image is preprocessed by resizing to 256*x*256 and then using ten different subcrops. The training for 70 epochs took 12 days on single GTX580 GPU. I highly request the reader to look into the paper for *Feature Visualization*. Feature Visualizations for each layer is shown in the paper with clear explanations. The lower-level layers are learning edges, colours and middle layers learning basic shapes for the object in the image. Final layer learning the whole object in the image. While visualization of a trained model gives insight
into its operation, it can also assist with selecting good architectures in the first place. They reduced the 1st layer filter size from 11*x*11 to 7*x*7 and made the stride of the convolution 2, rather than 4.
![](zfnet/zfnet.png)
*Figure 3. The architecture of our 8 layer convnet model. A 224 by 224 crop of an image (with 3 color planes) is presented as the input. This is convolved with 96 different 1st layer filters (red), each of size 7 by 7, using a stride of 2 in both x and y. The resulting feature maps are then: (i) passed through a rectified linear function (not shown), (ii) pooled (max within 3*x*3 regions, using stride 2) and (iii) contrast normalized across feature maps to give 96 different 55 by 55 element feature maps. Similar operations are repeated in layers 2,3,4,5. The last two layers are fully connected, taking features from the top convolutional layer as input in vector form (6*x*6*x*256 = 9216 dimensions). The final layer is a C-way softmax function, C being the number of classes. All filters and feature maps are square in shape.*

This architecture beating *AlexNet(single model)* by 1.7%(top-5 error), * best-published performance on this dataset*. The ensemble model achieved 14.8%(top-5 error), while the previous was 15.3%(top-5 error). Analysis of vertical translation, scale, rotation with other occlusion sensitivity is also done. The feature generalization is a great part of this paper. With very less training image, the pre-trained model performed very well on other dataset include Caltech 101/Caltech 256, PASCAL VOC. The necessary changes are done to fit with other datasets. On Caltech-256 with only six training examples per image resulted in the SOTA performance and with 60 training examples, it surpassed the best-reported results. Finally showed how the ImageNet trained model could generalize well to other datasets. For Caltech-101 and Caltech-256, the datasets are similar enough that we can beat the best-reported results, in the latter case by a significant margin. An ablation study on the model revealed that having a minimum depth to the network, rather than any individual section, is vital to the model’s performance.

### [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Read%20on%2023--AUG--2020-green">

**Brief:** This is the paper that showed depth is very crucial for performance. However, in the previous papers itself, they said increasing the depth will show better performance. Lack of powerful GPUs held increasing depth. Using tiny filters, we can achieve better performance than large filters used in previous papers. A 5*x*5 kernel has the same receptive field as two stacked 3*x*3 filter, and a  7*x*7 kernel has the same receptive field as three stacked 3*x*3 filters. An important contribution from this paper only uses of 3*x*3 filters in the entire Network. The use of small filters significantly reduces the parameters than the large filters. The architecture has a generic configuration and only differ in depth. Network *A* has 11 weight layers(8 Conv, 3 FC layers) and Network *E* has 19 weight layers (16 Conv, 3 FC layers).![](vgg/vgg1.png)
The advantage of using more small filter is, we can incorporate more non-linear rectification layers instead of one, which makes the decision function more discriminative. Moreover, we can decrease the no of parameters(let us look at one 7*x*7 vs three 3*x*3 filters, assume both i/p and o/p has the same no.of channels(C)). The output of three 3*x*3 filters has 27Csq parameters, and 7*x*7 has 49Csq parameters. 

```math
3(3^2C^2)= 27C^2,

7^2C^2= 49C^2
``` 

The ILSVRC-2012 dataset (which was used for ILSVRC 2012–2014 challenges). The dataset includes images of 1000 classes and is split into three sets: training (1.3M images), validation (50K images), and testing (100K images with held-out class labels).
Another notable experiment from this research is training at different single-scales  S = 256 and S = 384. For multi-scale, where each training image is individually rescaled by randomly sampling S from a certain range [S_min = 256, S_max = 512]. This is also can be seen as training set augmentation by scale jittering, where a single model is trained to recognise objects over a wide range of scales. Authors mentioned a way for testing, But I am not able to get it perfectly to put it here. This implementation is based on C++ Cafee toolbox but with significant modifications. These networks are trained on 4-NVIDIA Titan Black GPUs that a single net took 2–3 weeks depending on the architecture. While increasing the depth of the Network, the classification error decreases from 11 layers to 19 layers.Scale jittered model-E leads to **top-1 val error 25.5%** and **top-5 val error 8.0%**. In the multi-scale evaluation test images of are size Q = {S − 32, S, S + 32} (where S is the size of the image at training time). The 19 layer model-E produces **top-1 val error 24.8%** and **top-5 val error 7.5%**. We can observe that in multi-scale evaluation, the error further decreases by a good margin.Model-E(19 layer Net) with multi-crop evaluation and dense ConvNet produces still better results,   **top-1 val error 24.4%** and **top-5 val error 7.1%**. An ensemble of Model-D(16 layer) and Model-E(19 layer) with multi-scale evaluation + multi-crop + dense produces still better results than all of the above **top-1 val error 23.7%** and **top-5 val error 6.8%**. Remember that this result is ensemble on two models and other techniques being previously used. This result is very much close with ILSVRC-2014 winner GoogleNet with **top-5 val error 6.7%**. VGG team got second place in the classification task after GoogleNet. Another contribution is vgg publicly released the vgg16 and vgg19 models.

### [Going Deeper with Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Read%20on%2027--AUG--2020-green">
**Brief:** **GoogLeNet** is the winner of **ILSVRC2014** image  classification challenge. It showed significant improvement from the previous AlexNet(Winner ILSVRC2012), ZFNet(Winner ILSVRC2013) and little less error from the VGGNet(runner up in ILSVRC2014 classification challenge).<img src="googlenet/ilsvrc2014.png"> 
This network is quite different from AlexNet, ZFNet, VGGNet. It has 1*x*1 convolutions in the middle of the network and Global Average Pooling at the end of the network instead of fully connected layers. These techniques are presented in another paper *Network In Network*. The inception module is having different sizes of convolutions for the same input and concatenating all outputs. Inception word is taken from the famous internet meme *We Need to Go Deeper* <img src="googlenet/deeper.jpg">. In GoogleNet, the use of 1*x*1 convolution is used as a dimension reduction module to reduce the computation and introduce the non-linearty. The use of 1*x*1 convolution before 3*x*3 and 5*x*5 convolution significantly reduces the number of operations.<img src="googlenet/inception.png"> Inception module having 1*x*1, 3*x*3, 5*x*5, Max pooling layer with 1*x*1 convolution layer and concatenated at the output. Previously Fully Connected(FC) layer is used at the end of the network; All inputs are connected to each output. In GoogLeNet, global average pooling is used at the end of the network by averaging each feature map; this significantly reduces the parameters and increases top-1 accuracy by 0.6%.<img src="googlenet/architechture.png"> There are 22-layers in total this is deep model compared to AlexNet, ZFNet. There are several inception modules stacked together to go deeper. As we can see, there are some intermediate softmax branches in the middle that are used only for training. These branches contain Average pooling, Conv, FC, Softmax layers. The loss is added with the total loss with a weight of 0.3. 7 GoogleNet ensembled for prediction.This boosting approach is also used in previous models. Multi-scale testing is used just like VGGNet, with a shorter dimension of 256, 288, 320, 352. (4 scales)Multi-scale testing is used just like VGGNet.Multi-crop testing is used, the same idea but a bit different from and more complicated than AlexNet. A total of (4 scales×3 squares×6 crops×2 versions=144 crops/image)144 crops per image are taken.With 7 models + 144 crops, the **top-5 error is 6.67%**.From this, we can observe that, besides the network design, the other kinds of stuff like ensemble methods, multi-scale and multi-crop approaches are also essential to reduce the error rate. .<img src="googlenet/ilsvrc2014_table.png"> Finally, GoogLeNet outperforms other previous deep learning networks, and won in ILSVRC 2014.

### [Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Read%20on%2001--SEP--2020-green">
**Brief:** **R-CNN** is the one of the SOTA(state of the art) CNN based deep learning object detection approaches.  This method combine region proposals
with CNNs,So this method is called R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. Previous progress on various visual recognition tasks has been considerably using SIFT and HOG ffeatures. This approach also genralises using a pretrained model on a large dataset (like AlexNet) and using it for domain/task(like object detection) specific application. This paper show that usage of CNN can lead to dramaticcal increase in performance on PASCAL VOC as compared to HOG features based methods. Usually CNNs have been used in sliding window fashion with different scales and aspect ratios to detect objects in the image. R-CNN uses a different existing approach called **Selective Search** in a bottom-up fashion to get *Region Proposals*.This method generates around 2000 category-independent region proposals for the input image and extracts a fixed-length feature vector from each proposal using a CNN, and then classifies each region with category-specific linear SVMs.<img src='rcnn/rcnn.png'>
R-CNN significantly outperforms OverFeat(SOTA on ILSVRC 2013 detection) a mAP of **31.4%** versus **24.3%**.The principle contribution of this paper is to show that supervised pre-training
on a large auxiliary dataset (ILSVRC), followed by domain-specific fine-tuning on a small dataset (PASCAL), is an effective paradigm for learning high-capacity CNNs when data is scarce.This also demonstrate that a simple bounding-box regression method significantly reduces mislocalizations, which are the dominant error mode. This object deection method mainly consists of three modules.The first generates *category-independent region proposals* (selective search’s fast mode).These proposals define the set of candidate detections available to the detector.The second module is a *large convolutional neural network* (used caffe AlexNet model)that extracts a *4096 fixed-length feature vector* from each region. The third module is a set of *class specific linear SVMs*. After getting scores for all regions it uses greedy non-max suppression (for each class independently) that rejects a region if it has an intersection-over-union (IoU) overlap with a higher scoring selected region larger than a learned threshold.
<img src='rcnn/voc2010.png'> The method with R-CNN BB achieved best perofrmance of **53.7%** mAP on PASVAL VOC 2010 test set. The same method achieves **31.4%** mAP on ILSVRC 2013 detection test set.This super increase in mAP compared to previous best method OverFeat.
<img src='rcnn/ilsvrc2013.png'>.With Fine Tuning + Bounding Box regresson on the same model achieved  **58.5% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007** test set. After using the VGG16 as the pretraained model + Bounding Box regression it achived **66% mAP on VOC 2007 test set**.This method uses different split stratagies of availale labled data from val, test, train.Training data is required for three procedures in R-CNN:(1) CNN fine-tuning, (2) detector SVM training, and (3)bounding-box regressor training. CNN fine-tuning was run for 50k SGD iteration on val 1 +train N using the exact same settings as were used for PASCAL. Fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA Tesla K20 took 13 hours using Caffe. There is an interesting relationship between R-CNN and OverFeat: OverFeat can be seen (roughly) as a special case of R-CNN. If one were to replace selective search region proposals with a multi-scale pyramid of regular square regions and change the per-class bounding-box regressors to a single bounding-box regressor, then the systems would be very similar (modulo some potentially significant differences in how they are trained: CNN detection fine-tuning,using SVMs, etc.). R-CNN achieves **mAP of 31.4% on ILSVRC 2013 detection set**. Semantic segementation is also performed with same model with some modifications. This method achieved **47.9% Segmaentaion mean accuracy**, It is a 4.2%  over existing O2P(second-order pooling) best method.

### [Fast R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083)
**Brief:**  This paper made the R-CNN work faster in simple words.Fast R-CNN proposes a single stage training algorithm that jointly learns to classify object proposels and refine their locations. It is an imporvement of R-CNN and SPPNet . R-CNN has following drawbacks Training is multistage pipeline, expensensiive in space and time, object detection is slow(47s per image with VGG16).R-CNN is slow becase it performs a convnet forarward pass through each object proposal, without sharing computation.SPPnet computes a conv feature map for entire image and classifies each object proposal form the feature vector extracted form the shared feature map.Features are extracted for a proposal by max-pooling the portion of the feature map into a fixed sized output, Multiple output sizes are concatenated into a Spatial Pyramid Pooling.SPPnet accelerates R-CNN by 10 to 100× at test time. Training time is also reduced by 3× due to faster proposal feature extraction.We call this method Fast R-CNN because it’s comparatively fast to train and test.Fast R-CNN method has serveral advatages 

1. Higher detection quality (mAP) than R-CNN, SPPnet 
2. Training is single-stage, using a multi-task loss 
3. Training can update all network layers 4)No disk storage is required for feature caching.

<img src="fastrcnn/fastrcnn.png">
A Fast R-CNN network takes input an entire image and set of object proposals(from selective search "quality mode"), the network first processes whole image with several conv and max-pool layers to produce feature maps. Then each object proposal with Region of Intrest(RoI) pooling layer extracts fixed length feature vector from the feature map. Each feature vector is fed into  sequence of fully connected layers : one produces K+1 softmax class probalilities and another with 4 values(r, c, h, w) repesenting a bounding box.
<img src="fastrcnn/fastrcnn1.png">
RoI projects and RoI pooling are most important parts of the paper after that we will get a fixed size(7*x*7) feature ouput.Fast R-CNN has a **Multi-task loss** to handle both clssification and bounding box regression. Back Propagation is also possible through RoI layers.
<img src="fastrcnn/loss.png">
In Image classificatio time taken for computing FC layers is less compared to Conv layers, But for Detection it is quite opposite.Large FC layers are easily accelrated by Truncated SVD. Truncated SVD significantly reduces the computations in FC layers. Three main results from this paper are :

1. SOTA mAP on VOC07,2010 and 2012, 
2. Fast training and testing compared to R-CNN and SPPNet, 
3. Fine Tuning conv layers in VGG-16 improves mAP.

Tests have been conducted with three models S(AlexNet),M(AlexNet but Wider), L(VGG16). Fast R-CNN achieves a top result on **VOC12 with a mAP of 65.7% (68.4% with extra data)**. On VOC10 Fast R-CNN with data from **VOC07(trainval) + VOC07(test) + VOC12(trainval) achieves a mAP of 68.8%** surpassing segDeepM. On **VOC07 Fast R-CNN achieves mAP of 66.9%** , **training without diffuclt marked examples gives mAP of 68.1%** and with **VOC07(trainval) + VOC12(trainval) achieves mAP of 70%**. The main improvement form R-CNN is not mAP but the inferenece speed. Fast R-CNN took 0.32s/img without truncated SVD and 0.22s/img with truncated SVD while R-CNN took 47s/img and SPPNet took 2.3s/img. Truncated SVD reduces forward pass timing from 320ms/img(mAP 66.9%) to 223ms/img(mAP 66.6%). For MS-COCO dataset Fast R-CNN achieves **PASCAL-style mAP is 35.9%** and new COCO-style AP, which also averages over IoU thresholds, is **19.7%**.

### [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=9281510746729853742&btnI=1&hl=en) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Read%20on%2016--AUG--2020-green">


**Brief:** As Deeper neural networks are becoming challenging to train at that time, Residual Learning pushes and breaks all the SOTA results. It proposes a novel residual learning function instead of learning unreferenced functions. It involves a reformulation in stacking the layers for deeper architectures. In 2015 the best performing model was GoogleNet, which uses Inception modules and stacking them that worked well. As we continue to increase the depth of the models, they are not performing well. Yes, its the problem in 2015. For example, an 18-layer plain network giving better performance than a 34-layer plain network. As we increase the depth, the training error is increasing, and the test is also increasing. So we cannot take it as overfitting. The training error is less for overfitting, and the test error is more compared with less deep networks. ![Comparision for 20 and 56 layer networks](/resnet/comparision.png). You can observe that a 20-layer network is giving better results than a 56-layer network. The proposed residual learning and shortcut connections proved accuracy gains with an increase in depth.![Block of the residual net](/resnet/block.png). Shortcut connections are those which skip one or more layers. In this case, shortcut connections do Identity mapping, and their outputs are added to the outputs of stacked layers. They used batch normalization right after each convolution and before activation. They have not used dropout or max out. Absolutely the results are stunning and considered as a breakthrough in deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks.

### [Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks](https://scholar.google.co.in/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=16436232259506318906&btnI=1&hl=en)  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-Read%20on%2017--AUG--2020-green">

**Brief :** This paper proposes a new architectural change in SOTA object detection algorithms. They introduce *Region Proposal Network (RPN)* that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. Object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. This RPN is a convolutional network that simultaneously predicts objects bounds and scores. Before this paper, regions proposal methods to rely on Selective Search (SS) and other inefficient methods. 
![Different schemes for addressing multiple scales and sizes](/fasterrcnn/pyramid.png). RPNs can predict anchors with different scales and aspect ratios. R-CNN is used mainly to classify the region proposals into object categories and background. Fast R-CNN enables end-to-end detector training on shared convolutional features and
shows compelling accuracy and speed. ![Faster R-CNN is a single, unified network for object detection. The RPN module serves as the
‘attention’ of this unified network](/fasterrcnn/frcnn.png). In the Faster R-CNN object detection system, there are two modules. The first module is a deep, fully convolutional network that proposes regions, and the second module is the Fast R-CNN detector that uses the proposed regions. The entire system is a single unified network for object detection. A RPN takes an image as input and outputs a set of rectangular object proposals, each with an objectness score. These object proposals are called as *Anchors*. ![Region Proposal Network (RPN)](fasterrcnn/rpn.png). To generate region proposals, we slide a small network over the convolutional feature map output by the last shared convolutional layer. This small network takes input as n *x* n spatial window of the input convolutional feature map, each sliding window will map to a lower-dimensional feature. This will be used by two fully connected layers --a box-regression layer and a box-classification layer. The maximum number of possible proposals for each location is *k*. The *reg* layer has *4k* outputs encoding the coordinates of *k* boxes. The *cls* layer outputs *2k* scores that estimate the probability of object or not object for each proposal. An important property of this approach is that it is *translation-invariant* , both in terms of the anchors and the function that compute proposals relative to the anchors. If one translates an object in an image, the proposal should translate, and the same function should be able to predict the proposal in either location. The loss function is a combination of *cls* and *reg*. We assign a positive label if the anchor overlap with the ground-truth box or anchor has an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) higher than 0.7 with any ground truth box. A negative label is assigned if it has IoU lower than 0.3 for all ground-truth boxes. ![Loss Function](fasterrcnn/loss.png). Faster R-CNN has been implemented on PASCAL VOC with *ZFNet* and *VGGNets*. This is very successful in generating high mAP on different combination networks. For the VGG-16 model, this detection system has a frame rate of 5fps on a GPU while SOTA object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007,2012 and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks.
